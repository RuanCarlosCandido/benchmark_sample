# Simple Benchmark Project

This project is a Maven-based application designed for benchmarking purposes, utilizing JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) and Docker for a streamlined and reproducible benchmarking process.

## Building the Docker Image

To package the application and its dependencies into a Docker image, execute the following command:

```sh
docker build -t simple-benchmark-project .
```

This command builds a Docker image tagged as `simple-benchmark-project`.

## Running the Docker Container

With the Docker image ready, you can initiate a Docker container using the command:

```sh
docker run --rm -it simple-benchmark-project
```

Key flags used in this command:
- `--rm`: Automatically removes the container once it exits.
- `-it`: Allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open, beneficial for interactive applications.

This command starts a container instance from the `simple-benchmark-project` image.

### Important Note on Configuration

Before running benchmarks, ensure the `Main-Class` attribute in your JAR’s manifest is correctly set to reference the class containing your benchmark’s `main` method. Modify the `pom.xml` file to include the `maven-jar-plugin` configuration, specifying the main class.

## Executing Benchmarks

Upon starting the container, your project’s benchmarks will automatically begin execution. Ensure that:
- Benchmark classes and methods are annotated in accordance with JMH’s standards.
- The `main` method is configured to execute the benchmarks.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize this project for benchmarking purposes.
